## Intro

This web demo generates an infinite stream of filibuster using [Chrome's built-in AI API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) powered by a local Gemini Nano LLM. Minimum Chrome version required: 127.0.6512.0.

Chrome's `promptStreaming` API is expected to change in a backward-incompatible way before its official release, which will probably break this demo.
